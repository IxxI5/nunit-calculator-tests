# Calculator Testing with NUnit

Author: IxxI5

### Description

Calculator Testing with NUnit
This example demonstrates unit testing in C# using NUnit for a simple Calculator class. The Calculator class includes basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The accompanying CalculatorTests class contains a variety of NUnit tests to validate these operations.

Key features of the example include:

- Setup and Teardown: Initializes and cleans up resources before and after each test.
- Basic Tests: Verifies the correctness of individual arithmetic operations.
- Exception Testing: Ensures proper exception handling, such as division by zero.
- Parameterized Tests: Utilizes NUnit's [TestCase] attribute to run multiple test cases with different inputs.
